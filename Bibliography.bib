  abstract = {Reverse engineering of biomolecular regulatory networks such as gene
	regulatory networks, protein interaction networks, and metabolic
	networks has received an increasing attention as more high-throughput
	time-series measurements become available. In spite of various approaches
	developed from this motivation, it still remains as a challenging
	subject to develop a new reverse engineering scheme that can effectively
	uncover the functional interaction structure of a biomolecular network
	from given time-series expression profiles (TSEPs). We propose a
	new reverse engineering scheme that makes use of phase portraits
	constructed by projection of every two TSEPs into respective phase
	planes. We introduce two measures of a slope index (SI) and a winding
	index (WI) to quantify the interaction properties embedded in the
	phase portrait. Based on the SI and WI, we can reconstruct the functional
	interaction network in a very efficient and systematic way with better
	inference results compared to previous approaches. By using the SI,
	we can also estimate the time-lag accompanied with the interaction
	between molecular components of a network.},

  abstract = {Systems biology is a new discipline built upon the premise that an
	understanding of how cells and organisms carry out their functions
	cannot be gained by looking at cellular components in isolation.
	Instead, consideration of the interplay between the parts of systems
	is indispensable for analyzing, modeling, and predicting systems'
	behavior. Studying biological processes under this premise, systems
	biology combines experimental techniques and computational methods
	in order to construct predictive models. Both in building and utilizing
	models of biological systems, inverse problems arise at several occasions,
	for example, (i) when experimental time series and steady state data
	are used to construct biochemical reaction networks, (ii) when model
	parameters are identified that capture underlying mechanisms or (iii)
	when desired qualitative behavior such as bistability or limit cycle
	oscillations is engineered by proper choices of parameter combinations.
	In this paper we review principles of the modeling process in systems
	biology and illustrate the ill-posedness and regularization of parameter
	identification problems in that context. Furthermore, we discuss
	the methodology of qualitative inverse problems and demonstrate how
	sparsity enforcing regularization allows the determination of key
	reaction mechanisms underlying the qualitative behavior.},

	the signaling pathway leading to these oscillations is a fundamental
	problem. However, a biochemically based formulation for the comprehension
	of the molecular mechanisms operating in the axoneme as a response
	to external stimulus is still lacking. Based on experiments on the
	<italic>S. purpuratus</italic> sea urchin spermatozoa, we propose
	a signaling network model where nodes are discrete variables corresponding
	to the pathway elements and the signal transmission takes place at
	discrete time intervals according to logical rules. The validity
	of this model is corroborated by reproducing previous empirically
	determined signaling features. Prompted by the model predictions
	we performed experiments which identified novel characteristics of
	the signaling pathway. We uncovered the role of a high voltage-activated

	the delay in the onset of fluctuations after activation of the signaling
	cascade. This delay time has recently been shown to be an important
	regulatory factor for sea urchin sperm reorientation. Another finding
	is the participation of a voltage-dependent calcium-activated <inline-formula><inline-graphic

	Furthermore, by analyzing the spread of network perturbations we
	find that it operates in a dynamically critical regime. Our work
	demonstrates that a coarse-grained approach to the dynamics of the
	signaling pathway is capable of revealing regulatory sperm navigation
	elements and provides insight, in terms of criticality, on the concurrence
	of the high robustness and adaptability that the reproduction processes
	are predicted to have developed throughout evolution.</p> },
